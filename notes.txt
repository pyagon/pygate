Today:
Reviewed the current code and added a few bug fixes and improvements. 

Next time:
Take a look at the db queries and see if they can be optimized. 
When a list comes back we should add them to a dict in memory for fast lookups. 
That way we don't have to query the database on every request. Improving performance.
